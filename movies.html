<h2>Back To The Future</h2>
<p>This was my first sci-fi trilogy and the exposure was lasting. The storyline was dope! Marty and his family lol. </p>
<h2>Fast and Furious</h2>
<p>I love all the instalments.</p>
<h2>James Bond 007</h2>
<p>All the instalments are badass. Top spy franchise. Same as Mission Impossible by Tom Cruise.</p>
